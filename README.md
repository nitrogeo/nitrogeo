<p align="center">
  a <em>student, developer, and creative</em> building thoughtful software.
</p>


## 🧠 what i do

I build tools that help people **think more clearly** and **feel less overwhelmed**.

My work usually lives where:
- productivity meets design
- systems meet empathy
- code meets creativity

I care about how software *feels*, not just if it works.
